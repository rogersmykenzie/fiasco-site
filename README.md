# About this Site
This site is an online tool to be able to easily and remotely play Fiasco with your friends. The motivation for this site came from a desire to play the game with a couple friends of mine, but we all lived too far away to get together. If you are unfamiliar with Fiasco, check out this [link](https://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/ "Learn More about Fiasco").

# Site Walkthrough

Due to the site still being a WIP, there are many many styling changes that I wish to make. Once those are completed, this section of the README will be updated with a walkthrough.
